# Week 2: Data is Messy

This project uses the San Diego Police Department 2016 traffic stop data.  The city makes a bunch of interesting data available at https://data.sandiego.gov/

By the end of this week you will be able to:

* Work with messy real-world data
* Identify when data is bad, and what to do about it
* Perform more sophisticated analysis in Tableau, including aggregations, formulas and new plot types

[This collection of "falsehoods programmers believe in"](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) is worth a good
look every time you start to work with a new type of data.  A good
example is 
[Falsehoods programmers believe about time](https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time),
which starts with "There are always 24 hours in a day."

[Guide to messy data for journalists](https://qz.com/572338/the-quartz-guide-to-bad-data/)
contains a good checklist for questioning the quality of a dataset.

[The Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) has data, tutorials, and links to some of the best work data scientists are doing with police data.  Thanks to Jan Overgoor from that group for helping with resources for how to approach the SDPD data.
